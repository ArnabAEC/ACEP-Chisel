# ACEP-Chisel or CESA

All files ending with .scala are the chisel codes of ACEP and the files ending with .v are the verilog codes generated from those chisel codes.

Though these are not the original codes used in the paper, but a personal project, however the generated verilog codes for the same will synthesise to give the same results as the codes used for the paper. Hence, if making use of this repository, kindly cite:
